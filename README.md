# Technomancers - Official Support repo for the Foundry VTT conversion
### Installation guide
1. Once purchased, you can download the module as an archive.
1. Extract the content into your `Data` folder. If you don't know where that is, you can find it in the `Configuration` tab in Foundry.

1. You should now have a folder called `[YOUR DATA PATH]/Data/modules/technomancers`. In there should be a module.json.

1. The module is now successfully installed, and you can activate it like any other in your game.

As this module only contains content, and no functionality, there should be no problem introducing it into existing worlds. However, backups are still recommended, as always.
