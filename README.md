## Buying the Module
You can buy the module on [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/384282/Technomancers-A-Sprawlrunners-Supplement--FoundryVTT-Module).

## Installation guide
1. Once purchased, you can download the module as an archive.
1. Extract the content into your `Data` folder. If you don't know where that is, you can find it in the `Configuration` tab in Foundry.

1. You should now have a folder called `[YOUR DATA PATH]/Data/modules/technomancers`. In there should be a module.json.

1. The module is now successfully installed, and you can activate it like any other in your game.

As this module only contains content, and no functionality, there should be no problem introducing it into existing worlds. However, backups are still recommended, as always.

## Content
### Rules Compendium
This compendium contains all the rules for technomancy. This includes the rules for both Fast Lane and Slow Burn Hacking, seperated into easy options to select which version of hacking you prefer in your games.

### Technosorcery
This compendium contains all the files needed to add Technosorcery as an alternative to the normal technomancy rules. This compendium also includes the Edges specifc only to technosorcery, seperated from the normal technomancer Edges for ease of organization. It also includes the powers that have alternate uses in cyberspace. Any power not listed is assumed to be the same as the core Savage Worlds Adventurer Edition power. Due to licensing rules, the powers only have the altered effects and links to the original powers.

### Sprites Compendium
Contains all the actor files to use for sprites, for use with the optional Technosorcery rules.

### Edges Compendium
This compendium contains the Edges for use with base technomancy; Technosorceror-specific Edges are found in the Technomancy Compendium.

### Limitations
Due to licensing limitations, powers that have a different description than they do in the core rule book, come as items with descriptions and a link to the original power, but without actual game relevant stats, as pictured below.

## Interaction with other modules
All documents within the module are linked to references to either the module itself, the [Sprawlrunners module](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/351063/Sprawlrunners--FoundryVTT-Module), or the [Savage Worlds Adventure Edition Core Rules module](https://gitlab.com/peginc/core-rules-issues). Those links will obviously only work if you have both of these modules installed and activated. This module relies on the base content modules as much as the PDF relies on the Sprawlrunner book and the *Savage Worlds Adventure Edition* core rule book.

As you can see in the picture above, the link to the Fighting Utility is broken, because the Sprawlrunners module has not been activated. Clicking on either `Resilient` or `Very Resilient` on the other hand, will open up the respective entry from the Savage Worlds Core module, as that has been activated.
